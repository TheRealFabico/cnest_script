# CNest Script

CNest is a script to support the developers in C#. It makes many things easier and contains much code of C++ dll imports

CNest is made for C# projects

## CNest or CNest Min?
That doesn't really matter. CNest min is a minified version of the normal CNest, which means, that the file is smaller and harder to read. 
All in all both files are totally the same
